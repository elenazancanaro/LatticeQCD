# LatticeQCD
Summer Project Lattice QCD
This involves an introduction to the path integral formalism, followed by exploring Monte Carlo methods and Markov chains. I will study various algorithms, including Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and Metropolis-Hastings, while addressing challenges such as critical slowing down, illustrated through the harmonic oscillator on the lattice. Additionally, I will learn strategies to mitigate critical slowing down, using approaches like machine learning, multigrid methods, and Fourier acceleration.
